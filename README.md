# Paywall remover
Automatically get redirected to a proxed version of news websites, this usually removes paywalls. (previously the 12ft.io version)"

A basic chrome extension that redirects you automatically to versions of popular news sites without pay walls using the google web cache.

Previously used the 12ft.io API. But that seems to have been shut down. Then the google web cache. But that didn't work very effectively. So now a random 12ft alternative.

Please make a pull request or create a issue to request new websites.
