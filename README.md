# Paywall remover
Automatically get redirected to a proxed version of news websites, this usually removes paywalls. ~~(previously the 12ft.io version)~~. Now using a mixure of different proxys to get around paywalls best.

A basic chrome extension that redirects you automatically to versions of popular news sites without pay walls using a mixture of proxies.

~~Previously used the 12ft.io API. But that seems to have been shut down.~~ Then the google web cache. But that didn't work very effectively. ~~So now a random 12ft alternative.~~ Seems like the the 12ft.io API is working again, so back using that one.

Please make a pull request or create a issue to request new websites.
