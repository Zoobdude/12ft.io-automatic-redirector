# Paywall remover
Automatically get redirected to the google cached versions of websites

A basic chrome extension that redirects you automatically to versions of popular news sites without pay walls using the google web cache.

Previously used the 12ft.io API. But that seems to have been shut down.

Please make a pull request or create a issue to request new websites.
